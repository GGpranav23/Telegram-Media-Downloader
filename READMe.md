# Telegram Media Downloader

Unlock the ability to download **images**, **GIFs**, **videos**, and **voice messages** from private Telegram channels and chats where downloading is restricted. This user script brings back the download functionality on the **Telegram webapp**, even in places where it's normally disabled.

## üöÄ Overview

**Telegram Media Downloader** is a user script that restores the download option for images, GIFs, videos, and voice messages in **Telegram Web**. It allows users to bypass restrictions on content saving in private channels, providing a seamless experience for Telegram users who want to save media content.

**Note:** Some features may only work on specific versions of the Telegram webapp (e.g., Audio message downloads are available only on the K version of the webapp).

## üíª What Are User Scripts?

User scripts let you **customize your browsing experience**! Once installed, they automatically enhance websites by adding features, improving usability, or removing unwanted elements. Scripts from platforms like **Greasy Fork** are written by other users and shared for free!

## üìÇ How to Use

This script works only on **Telegram Web** and is **inactive** in chats or channels where content saving is allowed.

For channels and chats with restricted media downloads, the script adds a **download button** for images, GIFs, videos, and voice messages. You can download them just like you would with Telegram‚Äôs built-in download button.

### **Features**
- **Download Images, GIFs, Videos, and Stories**
- **Progress Bar for Video Downloads**
- **No Progress Bar for Images & Audio** (since they download quickly)

---

### **Supported Webapp Versions**
- **WebK (K Version)**: [https://webk.telegram.org](https://webk.telegram.org)
- **WebZ (Z Version)**: [https://webz.telegram.org](https://webz.telegram.org)

This script should work on both versions. If you're using a different version of Telegram Web and it's not working, please [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Neet-Nestor/Telegram-Media-Downloader).

---

## üìä Check Download Progress

- **Videos**: A progress bar will appear at the **bottom-right** corner once the download begins.

You can also check the progress in **DevTools** by looking at the console logs.
